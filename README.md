Our main data source was a CSV file from Kaggle.com. The data set was made up of 13 columns and 129,972 rows. The information in this CSV file are wine ratings from all over the world. Our second data source was from Google API places. We used a for loop and API call to gather Lat and Long coordinates in order to match to a wine location.
